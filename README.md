# Learning Machine Learning with Python

Welcome to my repository! This is my personal journey into the world of machine learning using Python, inspired by the Free Code Camp Machine Learning course. 

## Introduction

As a computer science major with a deep interest in data science and AI, I wanted to expand my knowledge and skills in machine learning. This repository captures my learning process, projects, and insights gained from the course. 

## Course Overview

Throughout the course, I explored various topics, including:

- Introduction to Machine Learning concepts
- Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- Regression Techniques and Classification Algorithms
- Model Evaluation and Feature Engineering
- Data Preprocessing and Visualization

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects I've worked on:

1. **Titanic Survival Prediction**
   - I implemented linear regression to predict survival chances using the Titanic dataset, which helped me understand how to apply machine learning techniques to real-world data.

2. **Housing Price Prediction**
   - In this project, I built a regression model to predict housing prices, learning the importance of feature selection and data analysis.

3. **Iris Flower Classification**
   - I developed a classification model using the Iris dataset, which was a great way to grasp the basics of classification algorithms and model evaluation.

## Technologies Used

I used the following technologies throughout my projects:

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


Thank you for checking out my repository! I'm excited to continue my learning journey in machine learning and explore new projects. Any feedback or insights are always welcome!
